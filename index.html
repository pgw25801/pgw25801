	Hi! My name is Patterson Williams and welcome to my webpage. I am currently a sophomore finance student at the University of Georgia.
	I am originally from Atlanta, GA and went to high school at Holy Innocents Episcopal School. Throughout my high school years, I was super busy with 
	playing three sports (softball, basketball, and lacrosse). Growing up in Georgia, I have always been a big UGA fan. When I got into UGA, I wanted to 
	go here because I knew I was interested in business, so the Terry College of business was super enticing. I also received the hope scholarship which is 80% of tuition,
	so you can't really beat that. 
	</p>
	<p>
	As a freshman, I came into UGA as an undecided business major. I knew I was interested in business but didn't really know what specific major I wanted to do. I applied to the Kennedy
	Program, which is an elite business society at our school. Through Kennedy, I was exposed to different careers such as consulting and banking. It really sparked my interest with investment banking
	and private wealth management. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In the beginning of my sophomore year, I applied to the Apollo Society, which is essentially the sophomore program above Kennedy. Through there I've gained accounting and financial
	knowledge. I'm currently in the consumer staples sector where my group researches and pitches staples stocks to the rest of the class. I recently got an internship with Southern Alpha Equity Partners,
	a firm in Atlanta. I look forward to gaining real life experience and more knowledge about private equity.
	</p>
